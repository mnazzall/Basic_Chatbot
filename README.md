# Basic_Chatbot

A lightweight, interactive command-line chatbot written in Python. This project serves as a foundational exercise in string manipulation, dictionary mapping, and using Regular Expressions (Regex) for data extraction.

## Features 
* **Conversational Responses:** Can greet users, answer basic questions about itself, and respond to emotional check-ins.
* **Entertainment:** Ask it for a joke or a fun programming fact!
* **Smart Calculator:** Uses the `re` (Regular Expression) module to detect and solve math equations hidden inside natural sentences (e.g., "Hey bot, what is 25 * 4?"). Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (with divide-by-zero protection).
* **Graceful Exit:** Safely closes the program when the user types "exit".



## Prerequisites 
This script runs on plain Python. No external libraries or `pip` installs are required! 
* Python 3.x
